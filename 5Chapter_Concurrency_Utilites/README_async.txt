"Making this be cause the creator of C++ Bjarne Stroustrup stress this about thread. This must be understood for the low level programing he's creating blueprint for "async()" "

The line of thinking I have pursued in this cahpter is the one I belive to be the simplest yet still amoung the most powerful: Treat a task as a function that may happen to run concurrentlu with other tasks. It is far from the only model supported by the "C++" standard library, but it serves well for a wide range of needs. More subtle and tricky models, styles of programming relying on shared memory, can be used as needed.
