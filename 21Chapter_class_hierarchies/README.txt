The primary focus of this chapter is design techniques, rather than language features. 
The examples are taken from user-interface design, but Dr. Bjarne Stroustrup avoid the topic of event-driven programming as commonly used for graphical user interface (GUI) systems.
A discussion of exactly how an action on the screen is transformed into a call of a member function would add little to the issues of class hierarchy design and has a huge potential for distraction: it is an interesting and important topic in its own right. For an understanding of GUI, have a look at one of the many C++ GUI libaraies. 

GUI stands for graphical user interface AKA the button you press with you mouse of the icon you tap on your phone. Even the every chat box you use to post messages to your friends on facebook or twitter(not to anger elon I mean 'X') (that like being from chicago and calling the sears tower the willis tower or US cellular field what ever they call it now.).
